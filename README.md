### Learning points

- Spend a long time looking at the JSON object from the API, figure out what you'll need, and then extract it in ASAP.
- whatthefont to find fonts
- Mac's built-in "digital color meter" to find hex / rgb values
- SVG's from https://www.svgrepo.com/
- use https://flexboxfroggy.com/ religiously, skip through to go to the one you're trying to apply
- change the background color or add border color when tweaking styles to see the parent container easily

### Future additions

- autofill cities as the user types
- incorporate dark mode
